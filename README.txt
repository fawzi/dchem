DChem

A framework for chemistry simulation, sampling and electrostatic embedding in D.

It needs tango (the developer's library for D, http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango/ ), and blip http://fawzi.github.com/blip .
Its official webpage is http://fawzi.github.com/blip

License is not yet decided, most likely it will be GPL v3, but I still have to go though the files and clean up everything, so for now it is "ask the developer", i.e. me.
