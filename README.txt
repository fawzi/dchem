DChem

A framework for chemistry simulation and electrostatic embedding in D.

It needs tango (the developer's library for D, http://www.dsource.org/projects/tango/ ), rtest (my testing framework http://github.com/fawzi/rtest ), narray (my n dimensional array solution http://github.com/fawzi/narray ).

License is not yet decided, so for now it is "ask the developer", i.e. me.
